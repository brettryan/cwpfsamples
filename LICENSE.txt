Guidelines for including license text
-------------------------------------

To limit cruft within your source it is advised to follow these provided
guidelines as to how to cite licenses within your source.

Within the root of your project directory place a copy of each license used
within your solution, this should be named LICENSE.<license>.txt where
<license> is the license being used.

At the top of your source file use the following (equivelant to the language
in question) template.

    <filename>      - Filename of source file
    <date>          - Date file was created
    <time>          - Time file was created
    <year>          - Year file was created
    <organization>  - Contributing organization or individual in question
    <author>        - Individual who created the source file.

/*
 * <filename>    <date> <time>
 *
 * Copyright <year> <organization> All rights reserved.
 * Use is subject to license terms. Refer to LICENSE.<license>.txt contained
 * within this solution for full copyright notice.
 *
 *  Author: <author>
 */

Using this method you clearly state the license in question and do not
clutter your source code with license terms.
