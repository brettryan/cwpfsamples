
This is a real rough script I'm using to develop the application, it will be
the basis for how to create this demo in the future.

Create base solution
--------------------
 1. Create a new empty solution named 'LateNight'
 2. Create the following solutions folders
     - Application
     - Modules
 3. Create a WPF application Project named LateNight in "Application"
    solution folder.
 4. Open Properties for LateNight and change default namespace to
    BrettRyan.LateNight.
 5. Add an infrastructure project called "LateNight.Infrastructure" in
    "Application" solution folder.
 6. Open properties for LateNight.Infrastructure and change default namespace to
    "BrettRyan.LateNight.Infrastructure".
 7. Add a reference to LateNight.Infrastructure to the LateNight project.
 8. Delete default "Class1.cs" from LateNight.Infrastructure.
 9. Open properties for LateNight, navigate to the build tab and change the
    output location to "..\Build\Debug" for the Debug build and
    "..\Build\Release" for the release build.
10. Perform step #7 for the LateNight.Infrastructure project.
